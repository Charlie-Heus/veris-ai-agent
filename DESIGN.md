🧠 Updated Recommendation: Mistral 7B Instruct is likely your best choice
✅ Why:
You're not asking the model to write long explanations or hold multi-turn conversations

You're mainly testing precision, formatting, and calculation-based accuracy

Mistral 7B Instruct is:

✅ Faster

✅ More concise

✅ Less likely to “overthink” or add extra language

It handles direct QA well when the context is clear and the question is structured

⚖️ Comparison in This Specific Use Case
Feature	Mistral 7B Instruct	Nous-Hermes 2
Precision in short answers	✅ High	✅ High, but sometimes wordier
Tendency to stick to formats	✅ Strong	⚠️ Sometimes verbose
Chain-of-thought / Tool calls	⚠️ Needs guidance	✅ Slightly better out-of-box
Overhead (tokens, verbosity)	✅ Lean	⚠️ Heavier responses if not prompted tightly
Total performance on short-form QA	✅ Very strong	✅ Also good, but more tuning needed for brevity

🧠 Strategy Shift
If you're working with short, numeric, or direct answers, then:

You likely won’t benefit as much from Hermes-style multi-step reasoning

What matters more is correct retrieval + calculation + formatting

That puts the burden of logic on your tools and prompt design, not on the model's chain-of-thought

✅ TL;DR
Goal	Pick
You want fast, concise, structured answers (like $2,244)	✅ Mistral 7B Instruct
You want verbose step-by-step reasoning or tool chaining	Maybe Nous-Hermes 2
You want to keep model output tightly controlled	Mistral is safer out of the box
