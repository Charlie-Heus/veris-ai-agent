EXPECTED ANSWER:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION #138
Type: conceptual
Company: N/A

QUESTION:
How does a 100-dollar asset write-down at a 20% tax rate affect each financial statement?

EXPECTED ANSWER:
On the income statement, pre-tax income goes down by 100, and net income is down by 80. On the cash flow statement, net income is down by 80, but you add back 100 because it was a non-cash expense, so cash is up by 20. On the balance sheet, cash is up by 20, some sort of PP&E or asset is down by 100, which means assets are down by 80. Since net income, which is in shareholders equity is down by 80, the balance sheet balances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION #139
Type: conceptual
Company: N/A

QUESTION:
Imagine a company disposes of an asset booked at 60 and receives 120 in proceeds. How would this transaction affect the three financial statements, assuming a 20% tax rate?

EXPECTED ANSWER:
On the income statement, there is a gain of 60, increasing net income by 60 * (1-0.2) = $48. On the cash flow statement, net income is up by 48 in the operating activities. Gain on sales is a non-cash expense, reducing cash flow from operations by $60, leaving cash flow from operations down by $12. In the investing activities, proceeds from asset sales increase by $120, leaving cash overall up $120 -$12 = $108. 
On the balance sheet, cash is up by $108, and PP&E is down by $60, leaving assets up $48. Shareholders equity is increased by $48 as well due to the increase in net income.

QUESTION #141
Type: conceptual
Company: N/A

QUESTION:
A company records a $200 sale, receiving $100 in cash and $100 on credit. With a 35% tax rate, how do the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement each change?

EXPECTED ANSWER:
On the income statement, pre-tax income is up by 200. With a tax rate of 35% net income is up by 130. On the cash flow statement, net income is up by 130, but 100 needs to be subtracted since it was non-cash revenue (increase in accounts receivable), so CFO is up by 30. There are no changes in CFF or CFI, so cash is up by 30. On the balance sheet cash is up by 30, accounts receivable is up by 100 and shareholders equity is up by 130 from net income or retained earnings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION #142
Type: conceptual
Company: N/A

QUESTION:
Walk me through how the 3 statements are impacted by a merger.

EXPECTED ANSWER:
For the income statement, the individual line items are combined. New line items are added for revenue or cost synergies as well as interest expense if debt was used to fund the acquisition or a change in interest expense from refinancing. Deal costs are also included. In the cash flow statement, you would also combine the line items, making to potentially factor new depreciation and amortization from changing values of intangible or tangible assets from the acquisition. If there are any principal payments related to the new debt, make sure to include that. Finally, combine balance sheet line items and make sure to add goodwill as an asset if the acquirer paid a premium to market value.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION #143
Type: conceptual
Company: N/A

QUESTION:
How are the three statement are affected when a company buys $300 of inventory by issuing new debt?

EXPECTED ANSWER:
There is no immediate impact on the income statement since revenue has yet to be recognized at this point. On the Cash flow statement, cash flow from operations is down by $300 for the increase in inventory. The issuance of debt reduces cash flow from financing by $300 leaving net cash unchanged. On the balance sheet, inventory increases assets by $300 and debt increases the liabilities by $300.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION #144
Type: conceptual
Company: N/A

QUESTION:
Describe the outcome of a $100 increase in depreciation on the three financial statements, assuming an 12% tax rate.

EXPECTED ANSWER:
On the income statement, pre-tax income is down by 100, net income is down by 88 (100 * (1 - 0.12)). On the cash flow statement, net income is down by 88 and 100 is added back since depreciation is a non-cash expense. Cash is up by 12. On the balance sheet, cash is up by 12, PP&E is down by 100, so assets are down by 88. This matches with liabilities + equities, as retained earnings is down by 88, which is a part of shareholders equity,.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION #145
Type: conceptual
Company: N/A

QUESTION:
The firm currently has 200 of PIK debt at an 10% interest rate and faces a 35% tax rate, how will this flow through the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement?

EXPECTED ANSWER:
On the income statement, pre-tax income is down by 20 (200 * 10%). With a 35% tax rate, net income is down by 20 * (0.65) = 13. On the cash flow statement, net income is down by 13. However, since PIK is a non-cash expense it is added back, so cash is up by 7, which is -13 + 20. On the balance sheet, cash is up by 7. On the liabilities side, debt is up by 20, from the interest accruing to the principal. Retained earnings is down by 13, so liabilities + equity is up by 7 (20 - 13), balancing with assets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION #146
Type: conceptual
Company: N/A

QUESTION:
A business sells of an asset with a carrying value of 50 for 75. Assume a 25% tax rate. How does this affect the financial statements?

EXPECTED ANSWER:
On the income statement, a gain on sale increases net income by $25 * (1-0.25) = $18.75. On the cash flow statement, net income in CFO is increased by $18.75, however we subtract the non-cash $25 gain on sale, leaving CFO down by $6.25. Sale of asset increases cash flow from investing by $75, resulting in a net cash increase of $68.75. On the balance sheet, cash increases by $68.75 and PPE is decreased by $50, leaving assets up by $18.75. Shareholders equity is increased by $18.75 from the increase in net income.

QUESTION #147
Type: conceptual
Company: N/A

QUESTION:
A firm borrowed $300 in order to buy goods. It later sold those goods for $600, incurred $150 in operating expenses, paid 6% interest on the loan, and repaid 12% of the original principal. Assume a tax rate of 10% How are the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement affected after this transaction?

EXPECTED ANSWER:
In the income statement, revenue is up 600, subtract 300 for COGS, 150 for Opex, so EBIT is 600 -300 -150 = 150. Interest expense is 300 * .12 = 36. Pre-tax income is 150 - 36 = 114. Post-tax income is 114 * 0.9 or 102.6. On the cash flow statement net income is up 102.6 and you add back 300 since inventory went down (and was a non-cash expense), 12% of principal is paid back or .12 * 300 = 36, so cash is up by 102.6 + 300 - 36 = 366.6. On the balance sheet, cash is up by 366.6, inventory is down by 300. On the liabilities side, debt is down by 36 and retained earnings is up by 102.6. 366.6 - 300 = 66.6. Liabilities +Equity = -36 + 102.6 = 66.6. Balance sheet balances.
